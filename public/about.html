<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello All! My name is Ayan Sen, and I have approximately 12 years of experience in the customer service sector and banking industry. 
  Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding of how to provide exceptional customer service and build strong 
  relationships with clients.</p>

<p>My passion is cricket, and I always make time to watch matches and follow my favorite teams. When I'm not watching cricket, 
  I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, as well as traveling to new places with my beautiful wife.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to restart my career in web development, as it gives me the opportunity to work remotely and travel while pursuing 
  my passion for coding. I'm excited to learn new skills and create meaningful, user-friendly websites that help people achieve their 
  goals.</p>

<p>I believe in living a meaningful life where you follow your heart and enjoy each moment, rather than constantly worrying about 
  the future. My mission is to create websites that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable, while also pursuing my own passions 
  and interests.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss 
  your web development needs.</p>
